# deploy-pcf-aws
===

## Overview

This Concourse pipeline is used to quickly spin up a PCF environment using the [p-runtime gem](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/p-runtime). The purpose of this pipeline is to quickly provider test/development PCF environments on AWS.

* The pipeline will deploy a single-az PCF environment on AWS with a self-signed cert.

* The pipeline of interest is named: **deploy-pcf-aws.yml**

* This pipeline is separated into 3 pipeline groups:

  * bootstrap-aws
  * deploy-pcf
  * destroy-pcf-aws

  
## deploy-pcf-aws.yml

#### Prerequisites:

* Concourse deployment that has access to environments.toolsmiths.cf-app.com
* Github key that has access to pivotal-cf/p-runtime
* Pivnet API token

#### Caveats:

You will need to manually create the wildcard A record to point to your PcfELB after your cloudformation script has created your ELB:

```
*.<SYSTEM-DOMAIN> = <YOUR-PCF-ELB-DNS>
```

#### Usage:

Edit deploy-pcf-aws.yml and configure the following values at the top of the file:

```
# === concourse ===
worker_tag: &worker_tag
github_user: &github_user cf-toolsmiths
github_email: &github_email cf-toolsmiths@pivotal.io
github_key: &github_key {{github-key}}

# === pivnet ===
pivnet_token: &pivnet_token {{pivnet-token}}

```

### bootstrap-aws

The pipeline group will do the following:

* Generate a self-signed certificate and upload to AWS IAM using the awscli
* Upload your private key to your AWS account
* Download the corresponding cloudformation.json from Pivotal Network
* Run the cloudformation template using your defined aws credentials, regions, azs

### deploy-pcf

This pipeline group will do the following:

* Verify or generate your <ENVIRONMENT>.yml inside your environment repo
* Create your ops manager vm inside the region you specified
* Configure your Ops Manager director
* Download and upload the specified ERT tile from Pivotal Network and upload it to Ops Manager
* Configure the Elastic Runtime tile to use the self-signed cert, s3 buckets, rds instance and etc. all generated from the first bootstrap-aws pipeline group
* The pipeline will then trigger your install and you will have a working PCF deployment!

### destroy-pcf-aws

This pipeline group has two manual triggers:

* **destroy-pcf-aws:** This step will purge your AWS account of everything in your environment. It will delete your PCF deployment as well as tear down all the subnets, RDS instances, VPCs and etc generated by your cloudformation script

* **delete-all-bootstrap-resources:** This step is used if you made a mistake in your bootstrapping process. This step will delete the key uploaded to your AWS account as well as delete the cloudformation stack.
